# Car Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes a dataset of cars, exploring various attributes such as mileage, engine size, fuel type, and price. The goal is to uncover trends in vehicle performance and pricing, providing insights for buyers and sellers.

## Dataset
The dataset includes details on:
- Car brands and models
- Year of manufacture
- Engine size (in liters)
- Fuel type (petrol, diesel, hybrid, etc.)
- Mileage (in kilometers or miles)
- Price (in USD)
- Transmission type (manual, automatic, etc.)

## Key Findings
- **Mileage vs. Price**: Higher mileage generally correlates with lower prices, reflecting depreciation.
- **Engine Size vs. Fuel Efficiency**: Larger engines tend to have lower fuel efficiency but higher power output.
- **Transmission Type Trends**: Automatic cars are more expensive on average compared to manual ones.
- **Fuel Type Preference**: Petrol cars dominate the dataset, but hybrid and electric vehicles are gaining traction.
- **Popular Brands**: Some brands retain their value better than others due to reliability and market demand.

## Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing price distributions across different attributes.
   - Checking correlations between engine size, fuel efficiency, and pricing.
   - Identifying outliers in pricing and mileage.
3. **Insights & Conclusion**: Summarizing major trends in the automobile market.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration
